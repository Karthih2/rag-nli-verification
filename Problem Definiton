!! Problem Statement !!

Large Language Models are widely used for question-answering tasks over enterprise documents such as policies, manuals, and reports. To improve answer relevance, Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques are commonly adopted, where relevant document content is retrieved before generating responses. These systems are increasingly deployed in real-world organizational settings.

Despite retrieval support, such systems often generate answers that contain hallucinated or unsupported information. This problem occurs when the retrieved context is incomplete, loosely related, or ambiguous, leading the model to produce plausible but incorrect statements. In enterprise environments, these inaccuracies can result in misinformation, compliance risks, and reduced trust in automated systems.

Current evaluation approaches mainly rely on semantic similarity and heuristic metrics, which are insufficient to determine whether a generated response is logically supported by the source document. Consequently, there is a significant challenge in reliably identifying when an answer deviates from the factual content of enterprise documents, highlighting the need for more robust assessment of answer reliability.


!! Definition of Hallucination !!

In the context of document-based question-answering systems, a hallucination refers to any generated response that is not logically supported by the source document. Hallucinations are categorized based on the logical relationship between the generated answer and the retrieved document content.

Entailed

A response is entailed if the information stated in the answer is explicitly or logically supported by the content of the source document. All facts in the answer can be directly inferred from the retrieved text without introducing new or unsupported information.

Neutral

A response is neutral if the answer contains information that is not stated or implied in the source document. Although the response may appear plausible, the document does not provide sufficient evidence to confirm or deny the claim.

Contradiction

A response is a contradiction if it conflicts with or is disproven by the information present in the source document. The generated answer states facts that are inconsistent with the document content.
